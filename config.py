'''The WTF_CSRF_ENABLED setting activates the cross-site request forgery prevention (note that this setting is enabled by default in current versions of Flask-WTF).'''

'''The SECRET_KEY setting is only needed when CSRF is enabled, and is used to create a cryptographic token that is used to validate a form. When you write your own apps make sure to set the secret key to something that is difficult to guess.'''
